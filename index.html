              George Kusunoki Miller (ジョージ・楠木・ミラー, Jōji Kusunoki
              Mirā, born 18 September 1992), better known by his stage name Joji
              and formerly by his online aliases Filthy Frank and Pink Guy, is a
              Japanese singer, songwriter, comedian, and a former Internet
              personality and YouTuber.

              Aside from the comedic and often rap-based music he created under
              the Pink Guy alias, Miller also created more serious and
              traditional music under another stage name, Joji, which became his
              primary focus in late 2017. Speaking on his transition from his
              YouTube career to his music career as Joji, Miller said to
              Billboard "now I get to do stuff that I want to hear." In the
              article by Billboard, he specified that 'Joji' isn't a character
              like Filthy Frank and Pink Guy. "I guess that's the difference,"
              he continues. "Joji's just me."
